1.How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?
  38 lines.

2.What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?
  The first 10 means that the first value of var x is 10.
  The second 10 is for making sure there is an edge thicker than 10 pixals on the right side of the canvas.
  The third 10 means that there is a 10 pixals space between the begining of each line.
